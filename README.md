# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithm
Boston-House-Prices-With-Regression-Machine-Learning-and-Keras-Deep-Learning
In this repository, a regression analysis is conducted using different machine learning models. The study is led on the prediction of median value of owner-occupied homes, from the Boston house pricing dataset. The project is carried out by selecting different regression models and finding the most suitable one. The procedure consists in different steps ranging from data visualization, features standardization, model tuning and hyperparameters search to find which model is the most accurate in terms of minimal mean squared error, for the comparison of predicted prices with the real prices.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites
You need Python 3.x to run the following code. You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems. Python needs to be first installed then SciPy, as there are dependencies on packages.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
Alongside Python, the SciPy packages are also required. In Ubuntu and Debian, the SciPy ecosystem can be installed by:

sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython ipython-notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose
